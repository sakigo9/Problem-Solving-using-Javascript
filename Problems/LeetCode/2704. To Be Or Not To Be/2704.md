### JS Concepts Used :
    * Closures
    * `this`

### Interesting facts
    - In the solution which made use of this, if we have made use of arrow functions then we would have found it difficult to execute the code.
    - It's important to understand that arrow function doesn't have a this in their execution context. Hence the value of this.local will be `undefined`.
